1) Change VIDEOS_FOLDER path in localFlaskServer.py file to the desired location. This file is present in ASLClassifyApp folder.
Recorded Videos will be uploaded in this directory.
2) Run python localFlaskServer.py command to start the flask server in the terminal. This file is present in the ASLClassifyApp folder.
3) USE_GESTURE_URLS flag in AppConstant.java class can be changed to false if we want to load videos from local; otherwise, it will load from the server directly as default.
Note: If the expert’s video doesn’t play on 2nd screen, then we will recommend setting this variable to false and build/rerun the app.
